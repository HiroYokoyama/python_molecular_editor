# Project Philosophy

## 1. Vision

**“Simplicity at the Core. Limitless Potential.”**

We believe a molecular editor should be easy to pick up, yet powerful enough to handle complex research. MoleditPy provides a streamlined foundation for visualization that puts simplicity first, while offering an open architecture that allows for infinite customization and expansion.

## 2. Core Values

### Simplicity First
We believe in keeping the core software simple and fast. Instead of packing every possible feature into the main program, we provide a lightweight foundation. This ensures a responsive experience and allows you to add exactly the features you need via plugins.

### Open and Transparent
Trust is essential for science. MoleditPy is designed to be transparent, allowing you to see exactly how your data is processed. Whether you are checking a calculation or learning how the code works, the logic is always accessible.

### Freedom to Create
Your research is unique, and your tools should be too. MoleditPy gives you the freedom to go beyond standard menus. Start with intuitive built-in tools, and when you are ready, extend your workflow with Python scripts to automate tasks and interact with molecules in ways that fit your specific goals.

### Connected Ecosystem
MoleditPy works harmoniously with the tools you already use. It seamlessly connects with the Python scientific ecosystem (like RDKit and PyVista), creating a unified environment where visualization and analysis happen together.
