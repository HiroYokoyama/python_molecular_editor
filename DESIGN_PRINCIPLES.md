# Design Principles

## 1. Concept
**"A Programmable Interface for Chemical Research."**

MoleditPy is designed to be more than just a drawing tool; it is a **graphical shell** that bridges the gap between molecular visualization and Python scripting.

## 2. Core Values

### Minimalist Foundation
We keep the core software lightweight and focused. Its primary role is to handle molecular data and rendering efficiently. Specialized features are implemented as plugins, preventing the software from becoming bloated.

### Transparency
MoleditPy is built on an open architecture. Users can access the underlying Python logic to understand exactly how their data is being processed. There are no "black boxes"—only transparent, verifiable code.

### Flexibility & Control
We prioritize user freedom. Unlike traditional software that restricts operations to a fixed set of menus, MoleditPy allows direct manipulation of molecular objects via scripts. This empowers researchers to build custom workflows tailored to their specific needs.

### Seamless Integration
The software acts as a hub for the Python scientific ecosystem. It integrates natively with powerful libraries like RDKit and PyVista, allowing users to visualize computational results and analyze data within a single, unified environment.
