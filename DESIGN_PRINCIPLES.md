# Project Philosophy

## 1. Vision
**"Bridging Visualization and Code."**

MoleditPy is created to be a flexible workspace where molecular visualization meets Python scripting. It is designed to grow with your research needs.

## 2. Core Values

### Simplicity First
We believe in keeping the core software simple and fast. Instead of packing every possible feature into the main program, we provide a lightweight foundation. This ensures a responsive experience and allows you to add exactly the features you need via plugins.

### Open and Transparent
Trust is essential for science. MoleditPy is designed to be transparent, allowing you to see exactly how your data is processed. Whether you are checking a calculation or learning how the code works, the logic is always accessible.

### Freedom to Create
Your research is unique, and your tools should be too. MoleditPy gives you the freedom to go beyond standard menus. By using Python scripts, you can automate tasks, customize workflows, and interact with molecules in ways that fit your specific goals.

### Connected Ecosystem
MoleditPy works harmoniously with the tools you already use. It seamlessly connects with the Python scientific ecosystem (like RDKit and PyVista), creating a unified environment where visualization and analysis happen together.
