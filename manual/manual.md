# MoleditPy User Manual

## 1\. Introduction

MoleditPy is a molecular editing software developed in Python. Through an intuitive interface, it allows for the drawing and editing of molecular structures in 2D, as well as the generation, display, and simple editing of 3D structures.

**Main Features:**

  * **2D Molecular Editing:** Add, delete, or modify atoms and bonds; create structures using templates. Also supports user templates, allowing users to save and use their own specified structures.
  * **3D Structure Generation:** Generate 3D coordinates from 2D structures and perform structure optimization using RDKit or Open Babel (optional).
  * **3D Molecular Display:** Display 3D molecules in multiple styles, including Ball & Stick, CPK (Space-filling), Wireframe, and Stick.
  * **File Operations:** Save and load projects in a proprietary format (.pmeprj). Supports import and export of standard chemical file formats (MOL, SDF, XYZ) and SMILES, InChI strings. Exported files can be used for DFT calculations. Also supports exporting as images (PNG) or 3D models (STL, OBJ) for 3D printing.
  * **Molecular Analysis:** Display basic molecular properties such as SMILES, InChI, Molecular Formula, Molecular Weight, LogP, and TPSA.
  * **3D Measurement:** Measure distances between atoms, angles between three atoms, and dihedral angles between four atoms in the 3D view.
  * **3D Editing:** Translate the entire molecule, flatten selected atoms, align to specific axes, adjust bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles, and create mirror images.
  * **Customization:** Configure 3D display settings such as background color, lighting, and detailed display styles.

  * **Bond buttons (Single bond, Double bond, etc.):** Mode for adding or changing the corresponding type of bond. Drag between atoms to create a bond; click an existing bond to change its type.
  * **Charge buttons (+/-):** Mode for increasing or decreasing the charge on an atom by clicking it. Right-click to reset the charge to 0.
  * **Radical button (Radical):** Mode for toggling the number of radical electrons on an atom (0 -\> 1 -\> 2 -\> 0) by clicking it. Right-click to reset to 0.
  * **Template buttons (Benzene ring, etc.):** Mode for adding a template structure by clicking on the canvas. It can also snap to and merge with existing atoms or bonds.

### 4.2. Atom and Bond Operations

  * **Adding an Atom:**
    1.  Select the desired element button from the toolbar (e.g., 'C').
    2.  Click anywhere on the canvas to place an atom of that element.
  * **Adding a Bond:**
    1.  Select the desired bond button from the toolbar (e.g., Single bond).
    2.  Press the mouse button on Atom A, drag to Atom B, and release to create a bond between A and B.
    3.  Start dragging in an empty area and release on Atom A to create a new atom (default Carbon) at the start point, bonded to Atom A.

## 6\. 3D Functions

MoleditPy provides functions to generate, display, measure, and edit 3D structures from the drawn 2D structure.

### 6.1. 2D to 3D Conversion

1.  Draw a molecular structure in the 2D Edit View.
2.  Click the **Convert 2D to 3D** button in the bottom left, or select `Edit` \> `Convert 2D to 3D` (Ctrl+K) from the menu.
3.  The calculation begins, and progress is displayed in the status bar. 3D coordinates are generated using RDKit (ETKDGv2 algorithm), and a simple structure optimization is performed using a force field (MMFF94 or UFF).
4.  Upon success, the generated 3D structure is displayed in the 3D View.

**(Settings):** You can set the priority of libraries (RDKit, Open Babel) used for conversion from the menu `Settings` \> `3D Conversion`. If Open Babel is not installed, related options will be disabled.

### 6.2. 3D Structure Optimization

  * With a 3D structure displayed, click the **Optimize 3D** button in the bottom right, or select `Edit` \> `Optimize 3D` (Ctrl+L) from the menu.
  * A more detailed structure optimization calculation is performed using the selected force field (MMFF or UFF).
  * When completed, the optimized structure is redrawn in the 3D view.

**(Settings):** You can select the force field calculation library and method (RDKit MMFF/UFF) from the menu `Edit` \> `3D Optimization Settings` or `Settings` \> `3D Optimization Settings`.

### 6.3. Changing 3D Display Style

You can select the display style from the **3D Style** dropdown menu on the right side of the main toolbar.

  * **Ball & Stick:** Displays atoms as spheres (a scaled-down version of van der Waals radii) and bonds as sticks. This is the standard style.
  * **CPK (Space-filling):** Displays atoms as space-filling spheres based on their van der Waals radii. Suitable for visualizing the volume and shape of the molecule.
  * **Wireframe:** Displays only bonds as thin lines. Atoms are not displayed.
  * **Stick:** Displays bonds as thick sticks and atoms as small spheres.

**(Settings):** Details for each display style (atom size, bond radius, rendering quality, etc.) can be adjusted from the menu `Settings` \> `3D View Settings...`.

### 6.4. 3D View Operations

  * **Rotate:** Left mouse button drag.
  * **Zoom:** Mouse wheel scroll (or Ctrl + Wheel).
  * **Pan (Move):** Middle mouse button drag, or Shift + Left mouse button drag.
  * **Reset View:** `View` \> `Reset 3D View` (Ctrl+R) from the menu resets the camera position and zoom to their initial state.

### 6.5. 3D Measurement Function ("3D Select" Mode)

1.  Click the **3D Select** button on the main toolbar to enable measurement mode.

2.  Click atoms in the 3D view to select them. Selected atoms are displayed with red labels in order (1, 2, 3, 4).

3.  Depending on the number of selected atoms, the following measurements are calculated and displayed in the upper-left corner of the 3D view:

      * **2 atoms selected:** Distance between atoms (Ã…)
      * **3 atoms selected:** Distance (1-2) and Angle (1-2-3) (Â°)
      * **4 atoms selected:** Distance (1-2), Angle (1-2-3), and Dihedral Angle (1-2-3-4) (Â°)

4.  Clicking anywhere other than an atom, clicking the **Clear Selection** button (if visible), or clicking the **3D Select** button again to exit the mode will clear the selection and measurements.

### 6.6. 3D Editing Function ("3D Drag" Mode / Alt Key)

You can directly edit the atomic coordinates of the 3D structure. Turn on the **3D Drag** button on the main toolbar, or perform operations **while holding down the Alt key**.

  * **Atom Drag:** In 3D Drag mode, clicking and dragging an atom allows you to move it in 3D space. The position is confirmed when you release the mouse button.

  ![](img/atom-drag.png)

**Other 3D Editing Functions (Menu `3D Edit`):**

These functions are available from the menu when a 3D structure is displayed. Many open a dedicated dialog where you can select atoms or input parameters.

  * **Translation...:** Translates the entire molecule or a selected group of atoms by specified coordinates.

  * **Align to \> Axis \> (X/Y/Z)-axis...:** Rotates and moves the entire molecule so that the line connecting two selected atoms aligns with the specified coordinate axis (X, Y, or Z) (the first atom is placed at the origin, the second on the axis).

  * **Mirror...:** Creates a mirror image of the entire molecule with respect to a specified plane (XY, XZ, YZ).

  * **Adjust Bond Length...:** Changes the distance between two selected atoms to a specified value. You can choose to fix one atom (or its connected group) or move both.

  * **Adjust Angle...:** Changes the angle formed by three selected atoms (1-2-3) to a specified value. You can choose to rotate the atom 3 side (or its connected group) or rotate both arms equally.

  * **Adjust Dihedral Angle...:** Changes the dihedral angle formed by four selected atoms (1-2-3-4) to a specified value. You can choose to rotate the atom 4 side (or its connected group) or rotate both groups equally.
