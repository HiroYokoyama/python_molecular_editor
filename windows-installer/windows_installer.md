# MoleditPy Windows Installer

## Overview

MoleditPy is a cross-platform, simple, and intuitive molecular editor built in Python.
This installer provides a package built for the Windows environment.

## About This Version

This Windows package uses `moleditpy-linux`, in which the Open Babel library has been disabled due to compatibility issues.
While features dependent on Open Babel (such as some advanced chemical calculations and specific format conversions) are unavailable, basic molecular drawing and editing functions operate without issues.
